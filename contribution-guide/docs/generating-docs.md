# Generating Docs

The Grasshopper documentation is built with [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/). 
Mkdocs is a simple way to use markdown to build docs.

To add to the docs you simply have to modify https://github.com/grasshopper-cms/grasshopper-docs , and your changes will automatically show up here.

To add a new page to the docs, look at `mkdocs.yml`.
