# User Guide Docs

These docs are built using [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/).

[Install mkdocs with pip](http://www.mkdocs.org/#installation).

Docs are separate into two separate sections, the user guide - for learning
how to use gh in a project, and the contribution guide - for learning
how to add to gh.
